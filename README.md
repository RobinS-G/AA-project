Pseudo-code:

First, we choose a white background. We generate a chosen number n of rectangles on the horizontal axis that we rotate at an angle within a range from 0 to 2PI with constant steps of 2PI/n rad. Their size and position from the center are randomly generated but the rectangles get smaller or wider thanks to a condition depending on their distance from the center. We also make the rectangles transparent so we can see them overlap.
