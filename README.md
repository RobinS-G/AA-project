Pseudo-code:

We generate a chosen number n of rectangles on the horizontal axis on a white background that we rotate at an angle within a range from 0 to 2PI with constant steps of 2PI/n rad. Depending on the distance from the center, the rectangles get smaller or wider thanks to a condition. We also need to make the rectangles transparent so we can see them overlap.
